# Task-Definition-Language

## Description
The Task Definition Language is a domain-specific language for the development of heterogeneous multi-robot systems. It allows you to add your robots to the framework and then create a mission for a team of robots through a web interface. It is built on top of the robot operating system and is using an auction-based task allocation algorithm to distribute tasks amongst the robots.

## Eclipse Setup

Clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/95danlos/Task-Definition-Language.git
```

Install Xtext and Xtend:

In the eclipse menu bar click help --> Eclipse Marketplace --> search for xtext --> install Eclipse Xtext and Eclipse Xtend

Add the Task-Definition-Language Plugin:

In the eclipse menu bar click help --> install new software --> add --> local --> select the plugin folder in the cloned project, if the plugin is not listed uncheck "Group item by category" --> install the plugin and restart eclipse


Create a new Eclipse project:

In Eclipse click new project --> General --> Project

Create New folder call it Scr

Create a new file with the extension .tdl --> click yes when asked to convert to Xtext Project

* create a new file for each robot

* Create a new file and add Tasks

* Example files in multi-robot-simulation/robots

## Simulation Setup

Setup on simulation requires linux and ROS. Follow the ROS setup tutorial at http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation

Then install the Gazebo simulator by following the steps at http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing

Move the gazebo models from Task-Definition-Language\multi-robot-simulation\gazebo-models over to ~/.gazebo/models

Create a catkin workspace: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment

Create a new ROS package called multi-robot-simulation: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

Build the package: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/BuildingPackages

Copy the files form the folder called multi-robot-simulationfrom in the cloned project over to the new created package

Make the src files executable:

```
chmod +x -R ~/catkin_ws/src/multi-robot-simulation/src
```

Install python websocket client: 

```
pip install websocket_client
```

Start the server:

```
python ~/catkin_ws/src/multi-robot-simulation/server.py
```


Launch the simulation:

```
roslaunch multi-robot-simulation multi-robot-simulation.launch
```

Open the index file in ~/catkin_ws/src/multi-robot-simulation

## Setup on Real Robots

To setup on real robots follow the same steps as in the simulator setup above besides the gazebo steps. This must be done on all of the robots. 

Setup on real robots requires all of the robots to have ROS installed. Follow the ROS setup tutorial at http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation

Create a catkin workspace: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment

Create a new ROS package called multi-robot-simulation: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

Build the package: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/BuildingPackages

Move the src-gen folders for each robot to ~/catkin_ws/src/multi-robot-simulation/src on the appropriate robot

## Developer Setup


File --> import --> Existing Projects into Workspace --> Browse --> And select the Task-Definiton-Language-Project folder
